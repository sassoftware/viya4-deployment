          The 'cluster-logging', 'cluster-monitoring', and 'viya-monitoring' task tags are not supported.

          You must define at least one action tag during execution. For the 'baseline', or 'viya', tasks
          either 'install' or 'uninstall'.

        msg: >

          The 'viya' and 'multi-tenancy' tasks can not be run simultaneously. See usage documentation at

          The 'install' or 'uninstall' actions cannot be used with the multi-tenancy task. Only the 'onboard',

          The 'baseline' task requires either the
          'install' or 'uninstall' actions. See usage documentation at docs/user/AnsibleUsage.md
