          You must define at least one action tag during execution. For the 'baseline', 'viya', 'cluster-logging',
          'cluster-monitoring', or 'viya-monitoring' tasks either 'install' or 'uninstall'. For the 'multi-tenancy' task
          either 'onboard', 'cas-onboard', or 'offboard'. See usage documentation at docs/user/AnsibleUsage.md and
          docs/user/Multi-Tenancy.md

        msg: >
          Invalid tags: {{ ansible_run_tags | join(',') }}

          The 'viya' and 'multi-tenancy' tasks can not be run simultaneously. See usage documentation at
          docs/user/AnsibleUsage.md and docs/user/Multi-Tenancy.md

        msg: >
          Invalid tags: {{ ansible_run_tags | join(',') }}

          The 'install' or 'uninstall' actions cannot be used with the multi-tenancy task. Only the 'onboard',
          'cas-onboard', or 'offboard' actions are supported. See usage documentation at docs/user/Multi-Tenancy.md

          The 'onboard', 'cas-onboard', or 'offboard' actions cannot be used with the viya task. Only the 'install',
          or 'uninstall' actions are supported. See usage documentation at docs/user/AnsibleUsage.md

          The 'baseline', 'cluster-logging', 'cluster-monitoring', and 'viya-monitoring' tasks require either the
          'install' or 'uninstall' actions. See usage documentation at docs/user/AnsibleUsage.md
