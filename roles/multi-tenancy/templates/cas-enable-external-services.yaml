  # By default, the services are added as NodePorts.
  # To configure them as LoadBalancers, uncomment the following
  # service template and optionally, set source ranges.
  #
  # Note: Setting the service template to LoadBalancer
  #       affects all CAS services, including the publishDCServices
  #       and publishEPCSService if those are set for SAS/ACCESS and
  #       Data Connectors.

  # Note: Some cloud providers may require additional settings
  # in the service template. For example, adding the following
  # annotation lets you set the load balancer timeout on AWS:
  #
  # - op: add
  #   path: /spec/serviceTemplate
  #   value:
  #     spec:
  #       type: LoadBalancer
  #       loadBalancerSourceRanges:
  #       - 192.168.0.0/16
  #       - 10.0.0.0/8

  # Consult your cloud provider's documentation for more information.
