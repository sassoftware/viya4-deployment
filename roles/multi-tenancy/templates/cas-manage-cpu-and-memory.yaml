# This block of code is for adding resource requests and resource limits for
# memory and CPU.
# For memory, the AMOUNT-OF-RAM value is a numeric value followed by the units,
# such as 32Gi for 32 gigabytes. In Kubernetes, the units for gigabytes is Gi and
# is case-sensitive.
# For CPUs, the NUMBER-OF-CORES is either a whole number, representing that
# number of cores, or a number followed by m, indicating that number of milli-cores.
# For example, 8 specifes to allocate 8 cores, and 500m specifies to allocate
# 500 milli-cores or .5 cores.
# By default, the requests for memory and CPU are set to 2Gi and 250m cores in
# overlays. The memory and CPU resource requests are customized in this patch
# by setting a replacement value. The CPU and memory resource limits do not
# have default values. The resource limits are customized in this patch with
# an add operation to set the values.
