**Notes:**
- These are the only third-party components installed by default by the DaC.
- All components are installed and managed via Ansible playbooks and Helm charts.
- Chart versions are managed in the Ansible variables and can be overridden by the user if needed.
- All components are compatible with AWS, Azure, and GCP unless otherwise noted. `metrics-server` and `ebs-csi-driver` are for AWS only.
- For more details on how to add or update these components, see the main playbook in `playbooks/playbook.yaml` and the role documentation in the `roles/` directory.
